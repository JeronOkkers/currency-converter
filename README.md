- Currency conversion with real-time exchange rates
- Dynamic dashboard displaying total conversions and preferred currency
- Conversion history visualization via line chart
- Toggleable dark mode for UI customization
- API integration to fetch exchange rates

## Getting Started

- [NetBeans 20](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Internet connection (for fetching live exchange rates)

### Installation

    git clone https://github.com/JeronOkkers/currency-converter.git
    cd currency-converter
    ```

2. Open the project in NetBeans or your preferred IDE.

3. Make sure your project is set up with JavaFX and other necessary libraries (refer to the `pom.xml` or build file if needed).

## Running the Project
1. Launch the application from your IDE by running `CurrencyConvertorTest.java`.
2. Log in or sign up as a new user to access the converter.
3. Convert currencies, view your history, and use the dashboard to track your statistics.

## User Authentication
- When you first start the application, youâ€™ll be prompted to log in or sign up.
- Sign up requires you to provide a username, password, preferred currency, and an option to enable dark mode.
- Log in to access your user data and continue using the converter.

## Converter
The currency converter allows you to:

- Choose the source currency and target currency from dropdowns.
- View the converted result in real-time.

## Dashboard
The dashboard provides statistics for:
- Total conversions made by the user.
- The user's preferred currency.

## History Chart
A line chart shows the history of your conversions, plotting the amounts against the order in which the conversions were made.

## Dark Mode
You can toggle between light and dark modes using the "Toggle Dark Mode" button. Your preference is saved and applied every time you log in.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaFX** for the user interface.
- **Google Gson** for JSON parsing.
